%
% Delay embedding is essentially appending to each multi-channel samples the subsequent k
% multi-channel samples, and thereby multiplies the number of channels by k. Delay embedding is a
% practical tool to extend linear spatial models (e.g., spatial filters or independent components)
% to linear spatio-temporal (and therefore implicitly spatio-spectral) models, just by applying
% those models to delay-embedded data. As a result, approaches that can learn optimal spatial
% filters (finding sources of interest) can be repurposed to learning optimal spatio-spectral
% filters (jointly finding sources and frequencies of interest).
%
% The tradeoff associated with delay-embedding is that the complexity of the models increases and
% they become harder to estimate, which might require more data or better
% constraints, priors, or regularization.
%
% In:
%   Signal : Epoched data set to be processed
%   
%   NumLags : the number of lags that shall be used for delay-embedding (default: 1)
%
% Out:
%   Signal : the processed signal; will have more channels
%
% Notes:
%   The temporal filters that can be designed for a small number of lags are often limited to 
%   high-frequency responses; the frequency range can often be extended without increasing model
%   complexity by first resampling the data to the lowest acceptable sampling rate (e.g., 60 Hz).
