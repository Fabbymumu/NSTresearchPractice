function onl_append(name, chunk, markers, stamp)
% Append a block of raw data to a stream.
% onl_append(Name, Chunk, Markers, Timestamp)
%
% This function appends a chunk of data (#samples x #channels) and possibly some markers to an
% online stream that was previously created with onl_newstream. It is also possible to pass in the
% time stamp of the most recent sample for accurate multi-stream synchronization (but usually not
% necessary).
%
% The number of columns in the appended data block must match the number of channels in the stream,
% and the data must have been sampled at the rate specified in the stream's .srate field.
%
% The sequence of samples fed into a stream (over the course of multiple calls to onl_append) should
% have no omissions (i.e., samples should not be skipped if possible) or repetitions (i.e., samples
% that have been supplied in a previous call must not be fed again) since the filters would then see
% jumps and glitches in the data as a result.
%
% Processing (i.e., appending samples and calculating predictions from them) does not have to happen
% in real time (i.e., the actual wall-clock time does not affect the calulated results).
%
% In:
%   Name : Variable name of the stream to which the data should be appended
%          (previously created with onl_newstream)
%
%   Chunk : [#Channels x #Samples] matrix of raw data
%
%   Markers : Optional struct array of markers in the chunk with one struct per marker. Each
%             struct must have a .type field that contains the marker type (string) and a .latency
%             field that contains the marker latency (where 1 is the first sample in the chunk and
%             #Samples is the last sample in the chunk). Additional fields are allowed, but note
%             that the field names of multiple successively appended marker structs must be
%             identical. Marker latencies should never exceed the bounds of the chunk. (default: empty)
%
%   Timestamp : Optional time stamp for the last sample in the chunk, in seconds, in some arbitary
%               time domain which is consistent across all streams used to make a given prediction.
%               (default: computed from xmin)
%
% Notes:
%   For many applications, accurate time codes are not necessary for reasonably good performance (or
%   not worth the development burden). For some applications, accurate timing across streams is
%   essential (especially if the relative lags are significant and temporal structure across streams
%   is being used for predictions). In this case, the time codes should be reasonably precise
%   estimates of the time stamp of the last sample, in a time domain that is the same across all
%   streams that are being used by a given predictor. This can be seconds since startup, or, for
%   example, the estimated (negative) age of the sample.
%
% Examples:
%   % get a chunk of new data from a device and append it to a (previously created) online stream
%   mychunk = get_data_from_device();
%   onl_append('mystream',mychunk);
%
%   % append both a 32-channel/1000-sample chunk and 3 markers
%   mychunk = randn(32,1000);
%   mymarkers = struct('type',{'test','sdfsdf','asd'},'latency',{10,300,801.5});
%   onl_append('mystream',mychunk,mymarkers);
