BCILAB
======

MATLAB Toolbox for Brain-Computer Interface Research

This software was written at the Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience, UCSD. This work was funded by the Army Research Laboratory under Cooperative Agreement Number W911NF-10-2-0022 and a gift from The Swartz Foundation (Old Field, NY).
The design of BCILAB was inspired by a preceding toolbox (the PhyPA toolbox) written in 2006-'09 by C. Kothe with contributions from T. Zander at the Department for Human-Machine Systems, Berlin Institute of Technology.

Guide to branches
-----------------
* master is the stable branch; most of the code has been tested over several months
* testing contains code that is currently being tested, or considered ready for testers; it is usually several months ahead of master and may contain a few buggy functions
* devel is the current development branch: it is the most up-to-date branch that integrates all features, but is frequently partially broken -- not recommended for regular toolbox users
* all other branches are "feature branches" that should not be checked out (most are inactive and have long been merged in, and some others contain half-finished code)
