To make a new cap design you need to put a .cap file here (these are just .mat files that contain that are required to contain certain variables). The following variables need to be in the .cap file:
* CAP: This is a regular EEGLAB-style chanlocs struct; you can create one from a file in a vendor-specific format 
       using the EEGLAB function readlocs() or pop_readlocs()
* MATCH: this is the matching rule for channel lookup; can be one of the following four strings:
         'exact', 'nocase_exact': do character-by-character matching, either case-sensitive or insensitive (recommended)
         'substr', 'nocase_substr': perform substring matching, either case-sensitive or insensitive (warning: this can backfire if your
                                    channels contain multi-digit numeric labels, like A21 (which also matches A2).
* NOSE: this is the axis that points in the direction of the nose, preceded by a + or -, as in '+X' or '-Y'
* SCHEME: this is a string that identifies the labeling scheme. If you use the 10-20 system, put '10-20' here; otherwise it's mostly up to you
          (allows functions to know how channels are labeled and act intelligently based on that)
* RECENTER: whether re-centering the cap after channel lookup is adequate; note that any asymmetry in the cap design (e.g. neck band) is 
            a good reason to disable recentering for the cap (optional; default: true)

The directory is used as a database of candidate montages (typically they should be gold-standard montages for a particular cap design, 
e.g. averaged across multiple subjects and pre-coregistered with an MNI reference head). The function set_infer_chanlocs will go through
all files and identify the best-matching montage for a particular set of labels or a recording (e.g., when X/Y/Z coordinates are missing from data). If a recording is available, the matching will, in case of ambiguity, be based on a comparison the channel correlation in the data with the channel proximity in the respective candidate cap (based on a fairly decent spline surface interpolation and correlation test).
