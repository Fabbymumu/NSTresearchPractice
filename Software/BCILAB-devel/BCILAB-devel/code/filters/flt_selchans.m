%
% Channel (or sensor) selection is a simple and effective method to constrain the complexity (and
% thus shorten computation time and/or improve robustness) of later stages in a paradigm. Sometimes,
% it is also employed to approximately restrict a paradigm to a sub-portion of brain processes (by
% using only channels directly above the brain region of interest), but this is not guaranteed to
% have the desired effect, since eletromagnetic signals emitted from any point in the brain are
% practically captured by every sensor (due to volume conduction). Other uses of channel selection
% are to exclude bad channels in a faulty recording or to simulate the behavior of a paradigm
% running on a subset of the sensors (e.g., for cost reduction purposes).
% 
% In:
%   Signal    : Data set
%
%   Channels  : channel indices or names to select
%
%   OrderPreservation : Output channel order. The result will have its channels either in the order of the 
%                       input set (if 'dataset-order') or in the order of the query list (if 'query-order').
%                       (default: 'query-order')
%
%   RemoveSelection : Remove selected channels. (default: false)
%
%   FindClosest : Find closest channels. This is for cases where the requested channels are not in
%                 the set. (default: false)
%
% Out:
%   Signal    : The original data set restricted to the selected channels (as far as they are 
%               contained)
%
% Examples:
%   % select only the channels C3, C4 and Cz
%   eeg = flt_selchans(eeg,{'C3','C4','Cz'})
%
%   % select channels 1:32
%   eeg = flt_selchans(eeg,1:32)
%
%   % reverse channel order
%   eeg = flt_selchans(eeg,eeg.nbchan:-1:1)
%
%   % retain all channels (i.e., do nothing)
%   eeg = flt_selchans(eeg,[])
%
%   % select a group of channels but keep them in the order in which they were in the original data set
%   eeg = flt_selchans(eeg,{'AFz','Fz','Fpz','F1'},'dataset-order')
