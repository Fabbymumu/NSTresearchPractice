<div class="fragment"><pre class="comment"> Uniformize the given trials and shape information.
 [FeatureShape,Trials,VectorizeTrials] = utl_determine_featureshape(Trials,Shape,Multitask)

 This function deals with the fact that trials can be represented either as [NxF] matrix of
 vectorized features (N=#observations, F=#features), or as [AxBxCx...xN] array of tensor-shaped
 features (A,B,C, ... = #elements in the respective dimension), which is a bit inconsistent for
 historical reasons.

 Takes trials in a variety of shapes, and an (optionally non-empty) desired shape vector and
 uniformizes them into a [#trials x #features] matrix of vectorized trials, the deduced feature
 shape, and a boolean flag of whether trials had to be vectorized. By default also handles a cell
 array of multiple trial arrays, which are assumed to stem from multiple compatibly shaped tasks.

 In:
   Trials : A NxF matrix of observations with pre-vectorized features, or a [AxBxCx...xN] array
            of tensor-shaped features. Can also be a cell array of multiple such arrays where all
            dimensions except N must be identical.

   Shape : A vector that is the desired output of size() applied to a single observation, that is,
           a vector of sizes. If [], shape information will be deduced from Trials, otherwise
           overrides the shape of Trials.

   Multitask : If true, the output will be a cell array of trial matrices. Otherwise it will be 
               a matrix (and an error will be thrown if there was more than one task in the
               input).

 Out:
   FeatureShape : Final 1xD vector that describes the feature shape (same as size(one_trial)).

   Trials : Vectorized version of input Trials (#trials x #features).

   VectorizeTrials : whether trials had to be vectorized.
