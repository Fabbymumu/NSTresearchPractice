Note 1: This is a minimally modified version of the TCP-UDP-IP toolbox 
with PTBMods by Mario Kleiner. 
- In pnet.c the C++-style comments have been replaced by C-style 
  comments to make it compilable with a default mex setup.
- the TCP receive/send buffer sizes have been upped to 32MB by default, 
  and a max variable size has been raised from 50k to 16.7m.
- the auto-compile script has been removed
