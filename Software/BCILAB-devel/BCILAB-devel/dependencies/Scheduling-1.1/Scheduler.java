// Task scheduler for use with MATLAB (used by hlp_beginschedule.m / hlp_endschedule.m / hlp_schedule.m).
//
// * Constructed with a set of known workers and optional policy / control parameters.
// * the workers are assumed to be host:port addresses at which there may be processes listening
//   that receive (tagged) task messages, and forward (identically tagged) results to the collector
//   indicated in the task message.
// * the task message is formatted as (<>'s not part of the format):
//    <task_id><collectoraddress_length><collectoraddress><body_length><body>
//    where
//      <task_id> 					: tag/identifier of the task (int)
//      <collectoraddress_length>	: length, in bytes, of the data collector's address (int)
//      <collectoraddress>			: where to send the result for collection (string, formatted as host:port)
//      <body_length>				: length, in bytes, of the message body (int)
//      <body>						: task representation (string)
//  * the response message format emitted by the workers (and accepted by the Scheduler) is:
//    <task_id><body_length><body>
//
// The Scheduler ensures that the given tasks are assigned to available workers, and that results are collected;
// all processing happens in background threads, and is initiated via submit(), probed via done() / results(),
// and supports waiting for completion (of tasks submitted so far), via wait_until_done();
//
// Teardown of the Scheduler's background resources is initiated by executing terminate(), and it should be run
// once the Scheduler is no longer needed. If not invoked, the Scheduler's (spacious!) resources will remain in
// memory indefinitely, which leads to out-of-memory problems relatively quickly.
//
// Multiple schedulers can be accessing the same workers simultaneously, and the same scheduler can be fed with multiple
// submit()'s and reused for multiple independent scheduling rounds, by calling clear() to reset it into its initial state.
// Since a scheduler consumes (memory/network/cpu) resources, a teardown and later re-construction of a new scheduler should
// be considered between extended pauses; clear() does not reclaim these resources (and therefore allows more efficient restarts).
//
// A critical issue in every scheduler is the handling of tasks that were scheduled but lost in transmission (e.g. due to
// a worker crash). The chance of this happening rises with the number of workers involved. The re-scheduling of in-flight
// tasks is issued by the custom re-scheduling policy, which is a user-supplied MATLAB function. It receives an
// event log (tracking what was issued and/or received when, and what errors happened when) and a list of currently in-flight
// task ids, and emits a subset of these task ids for re-scheduling; it is invoked periodically by the scheduler.
//
// The scheduling policy needs a matlabcontrol jar file in the classpath; this functionality can be commented out without breaking
// the scheduler's main functionality, with the exception of re-scheduling tasks that were lost by workers or the network.
