	  Wearable Sensing EEGLAB Extension 1.09
	  --------------------------------------

The purpose of this plug-in is to allow EEGLAB to read the
.CSV files produced by Wearable Sensing's DSI-Streamer software.
This will allow you to take advantage of EEGLAB's data processing
features to analyze the data you collect with Wearable Sensing's
dry electrode systems.

This plugin works best with DSI-Streamer versions 0.6.x and forward.
We recommend you use the most recent version, which can be accessed
from the Wearable Sensing website.

Version notes
-------------

1.00: Initial release

1.01: 
	Bugfix: Sampling rate error
	 -Sampling rate was not registering properly.  Now, the files loaded
	  into EEGLAB should have correct sampling rate and load EEG data correctly.

1.02: 

	New Feature: Backwards compatibility
	 -Previously, the plugin only worked with files generated by 0.7.x.
	  Now, it works with 0.6.x 

1.03:
	Bugfix: Corrected DSI-7 Loading
	 -Occasionally, DSI-7 would not load into EEGLAB. 
	  This has been resolved.

1.04:
	Bugfix: Reference Channel now properly loads.
	 -Previous versions of this extension did not actually
	  include the reference channel.  It should correctly load now.
 
1.05:
	Revisions: Clarified Filter type (FIR), changed default value
	 -Previous versions did not specify what type of filter was applied
	  to the data when it is initially loaded, and had a value of 100 as
	  default.  After testing, we believe a default of 70 is better.

	Bugfix: Lowpass Filter now works properly
	 -Previously, the initial FIR filter was not actually being applied 
	  to the data.  This has been corrected.

1.06:
	Revision: Event names are now "1","2", etc. instead of "trigger 1", "trigger 2"
	 -This is preferred for ERPLAB integration.	
	
	Revision: Minor documentation corrections
	 -The help file now correctly indicates [70] as the recommended default lowpass.

1.07:
	Revision: DSI-Streamer 0.7.31 has a function for including custom events..
	 -As of this version of the DSI-Streamer plugin, the comments are not registered 
          into EEGLAB, but at least this version no longer crashes.  1.08 should register them.
	Bugfix: if Trigger is at a non-zero value in the first time index, Plugin should no longer crash.

1.08:
	Revision: DSI-Streamer 0.7.34 should be able to load this version
	New Feature: Tidied up code should make loading larger datafiles faster.
	
1.09:
	Improved backwards compatability.  
		-Functions in previous version could only be used in 2013 forward.  This is no longer true.
		


    


Requirements
------------

MATLAB, version 2008 or more recent

MATLAB Signal processing toolbox

EEGLAB version 12 or more recent
(obtainable from the EEGLAB website)



Installation
------------

 
  1. In the EEG folders, find the following directory: /eeglab(VERSION)/plugins/ 
	-(VERSION) above will be the EEGLAB version, such as 13_3_3

  2. Extract the Wearable Sensing folder from the .zip file
     into that directory.
